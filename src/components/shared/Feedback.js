                        Quite well organized for a first session. Appreciate that they valued time. 
                        Speakers really knew their topics well.
                        The quiz was super fun! <br/>Overall a very good experience. 
                        I never expected anything like this in Ludhiana. 
                        Looking forward to future meets.
